  Task:
  Score the call using ONLY these criteria: KR2.1, KR2.2, KR2.3, KR2.4, KR2.5.
  Return JSON ONLY (no markdown), in this exact shape:

  {
    "KR2.1": {"score": 0-3, "reasoning": "...", "probability": "HIGH|LOW", "evidence_snippet": "[start-end] Speaker: exact words"},
    ...
  }

  Rules:
  - Evidence snippet must be verbatim text from the transcript, including a matching time range.
  - Never invent content. If evidence is missing, score lower and say why.
